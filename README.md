# Project 2: Extract, Transform and Load Mini Project
---

## Project Summary:

This mini project is to build up an ETL (extract, transform and load) pipeline. Two excel files were given for loading the data into the database. Two different methods (Python dictionary and regular expressions method) are used to extract and transform the data. The cleaned and structured data is then loaded into the pre-created table schema in Postgres database.
